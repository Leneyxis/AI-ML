## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of AI and ML projects, covering a range of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms. The projects are designed to provide practical implementations of theoretical concepts learned in various AI/ML courses.

## Projects
Below is a list of implemented projects and algorithms:

1. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Q-Learning
   - Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- OpenCV (for image processing tasks)

## Installation
To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/leneyxis/AI-ML.git
   cd AI-ML
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Each project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with explanations and code implementations. Navigate to a specific project and run the corresponding notebook/script.

To start Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
